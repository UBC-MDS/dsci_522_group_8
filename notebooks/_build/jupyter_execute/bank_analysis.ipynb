    "## Summary\n",
    "Here we build a model of balanced SVC to try to predict if a new client will subscribe to a term deposit. We tested five different classification models, including dummy classifier, unbalanced/balanced logistic regression, and unbalanced/balanced SVC, and chose the optimal model of balanced SVC based on how the model scored on the test data; the model has the highest test recall score of 0.82, which indicates that the model makes the least false negative predictions among all five models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The balanced support vector machines model considers 13 different numerical/ categorical features of customers. After hyperparameter optimization, the model's test accuracy increased from 0.82 to 0.875. The results were somewhat expected, given SVC's known efficacy in classification tasks, particularly when there's a clear margin of separation. The high recall score of 0.875 indicates that the model is particularly adept at identifying clients likely to subscribe, which was the primary goal. It's noteworthy that such a high recall was achieved, as it suggests the model is highly sensitive to true positive cases."

    "Term deposit is valuable to banks because it ensures a stable stream of income that banks can utilize. Banks usually invest in higher-return financial products or lend money to other customers with a higher interest rate to make a profit. With term deposits, banks can better predict their cash flow.\n",

    "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The data set used in this project was created by Moro, S. and Rita, P. and Cortez, P {cite}`moro2012bank`.It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository {cite}`moro2012bank`. We will be using bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). The raw data file can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)."

    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Initially, we ensured our data was complete by dealing with missing values and removing unnecessary columns like \"contact,\" \"day,\" and \"month.\" This streamlined the dataset, making it ready for analysis. We used StandardScaler to standardize numerical features such as \"age\" and \"balance\" and applied one-hot encoding for categorical attributes, making the data compatible with different machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection and Evaluation\n",
    "We used five models for classification, starting with a basic Dummy Classifier. Following models included Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), each showing strengths in accuracy and recall {cite}`moro2014data`. Notably, our balanced models—Balanced Logistic Regression and Balanced Support Vector Classifier (svc_bal)—performed best, especially in identifying clients likely to subscribe to a term deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Comparison\n",
    "An extensive evaluation, considering accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, highlighted the Balanced Support Vector Classifier (svc_bal) as the standout performer. This model excelled with high recall, crucial for identifying potential term deposit subscribers in our specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "Optimizing model performance, especially for the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using a reduced dataset, resulted in a final model with an impressive 86% accuracy and a notable recall of 87%. This optimization strategy enhances efficiency and fine-tunes the model for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall - The Preferred Metric\n",
    "In our bank marketing dataset, we prioritize recall. Recall indicates the model's ability to identify true positive cases—clients subscribing to a term deposit. In our context, missing a potential positive case is more significant than false positives, leading to potential losses and missed opportunities. Prioritizing recall ensures a finely tuned model capturing all potential clients interested in term deposits, aligning with our main goal."

    "In this bank marketing analysis project, we aimed to develop a binary classification model to predict client subscription to term deposits. We tested Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models, focusing on recall as a key performance metric. The SVC model outperformed Logistic Regression in recall, and after hyperparameter optimization, it achieved a recall score of 0.875 on the test dataset, which is quite promising!"

    "The results were somewhat expected, given SVC's known efficacy in classification tasks, particularly when there's a clear margin of separation. The high recall score of 0.875 indicates that the model is particularly adept at identifying clients likely to subscribe, which was the primary goal. It's noteworthy that such a high recall was achieved, as it suggests the model is highly sensitive to true positive cases."

    "The high recall score of this model has significant implications for targeted marketing strategies. It suggests that the bank can confidently use the model's predictions to focus its marketing efforts on clients predicted to subscribe, potentially increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of its campaigns {cite}`moura2020optimization`. This targeted approach could lead to higher conversion rates with lower marketing expenses. However, it's important to balance such a high recall with precision to ensure that the bank doesn't unnecessarily target unlikely prospects."
